Updated: 
Before client team had no hosting on server but now webclient is going to hosted so we can host this pages with web client.
This will avoid sending pages from client team to server team and generating proxy build for these pages only. Now client team can control this hosting.
Old location will still stay live until all client move to new location.

Original :
These integration pages are loaded on sky server URL https://socialconnect.sky.shoretel.com/linkedin/ as part of server reverese proxy setup.
server reverse proxy is handled by server team and all the code is located under following PBX branch.
//depot/projects/Cosmo4/ReverseProxy/source/endo/endolinkedin/

Because client stream is seperate from PBX branch , we keep copy of latest code in client stream for our reference.
If you modify these pages, then send copy to sever team to update PBX branch and send copy to cloud IT team if you want to update these files on cloud.
